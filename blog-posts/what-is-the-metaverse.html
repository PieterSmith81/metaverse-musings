              <br />
              <br />
              <h2>The new buzzword</h2>
              <p>
                Have you ever been confused by conversations around the
                Metaverse? You are not alone. If you have been frustrated by the
                conversations, I can assure you that you are not alone, too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ever since the spike in interest during 2021, thousands of
                companies and pseudo-professionals ruffled through their
                websites and strapped the word to as many of their marketing
                materials as possible, capitalising on an explosion of interest.
                Suddenly, companies that hosted private virtual worlds are
                building towards a Metaverse, or AR companies are mapping out
                the world to build it out. A comparable situation happened in
                2017 when Bitcoin exploded in value and "blockchain" was bolted
                on the side of new start-ups seeking venture funding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not all of these companies are providing substantial
                contributions to the discussions. The worst cases are companies
                that see they have a private world, and label it as a Metaverse.
                The conversation will become nuanced over 2022 and beyond, but
                currently, it is a rush of companies identifying a new business
                opportunity.

            <section id="defining-the-metaverse">
              <br />
              <h2>Defining the Metaverse</h2>
              <p>
                If you ask any of these companies what the Metaverse is, you
                will get a range of different answers. Some say it is a super
                Internet where people can access experiences, zipping through
                the Metaverse and going surfing, climbing, socialising and more.
                Others say it is a wholly social experience, where friends can
                hang out and conduct activities together. Still, others see it
                as a layer of reality, not a separate one: an overlay of
                information as people walk around the world. The madness of the
                conversations stems from the myriad of conversations that
                clutter social and mainstream media, obfuscating the view with a
                pyramid of poor takes.
              </p>
              <p>
                My favourite definition comes from Matthew Ball, an established
                essayist who has been following the space more than the
                futurists in Silicon Valley bars:
                <em
                  ><q
                    >The Metaverse is an expansive network of persistent,
                    real-time rendered 3D worlds and simulations that support
                    continuity of identity, objects, history, payments, and
                    entitlements, and can be experienced synchronously by an
                    effectively unlimited number of users, each with an
                    individual sense of presence.</q
                  ></em
                >
                A wide definition that covers many different technologies -
                hence the confusion on what the Metaverse will look like.
